## Objective :-
- We are `importing` the methods of [Dell](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages/Dell.java) and [HP](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages/HP.java) in our [Ashfaque](Ashfaque.java) `main()` method.

- Create a dir name [mypackages](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages).

- Keep the [mypackages](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages) dir in the same dir as of the [main class](Ashfaque.java) `.java` file.

- Keep all the `.java` files inside [mypackages](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages), if you want to keep it in the package.

- Also write `package mypackages` in the beginning of each `.java` files inside [mypackages](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages).

## How to Compile & Run :-
> javac Ashfaque.java
 java Ashfaque

You only need to compile the [main class file](Ashfaque.java). And a `.class` file will be generated for each of the `.java` file, even if its inside a [package](/[Java]%20Manual%20Package%20Creation%20Example/mypackages) and is imported in the [main class](Ashfaque.java) `.java` file.
