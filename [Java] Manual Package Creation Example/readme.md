## Objective :-
- We are `importing` the methods of [Dell](/mypackages/Dell.java) and [HP](/mypackages/HP.java) in our [Ashfaque](Ashfaque.java) `main()` method.

- Create a dir name [mypackages](/mypackages).

- Keep the [mypackages](/mypackages) dir in the same dir as of the [main class](Ashfaque.java) `.java` file.

- Keep all the `.java` files inside [mypackages](/mypackages) if you want to keep it in the package.

- Also write `package mypackages` in the beginning of each `.java` files inside [mypackages](/mypackages).

## How to Compile & Run :-
> javac Ashfaque.java
> java Ashfaque

You only need to compile the [main class file](Ashfaque.java). And a `.class` file will be created for each of the `.java` file even if its inside a [package](/mypackages) and is imported in the [main class](Ashfaque.java) `.java` file.
